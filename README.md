# Fashion Product Recommendation using Multimodal Data

## Introduction

In the contemporary landscape of online shopping, the significance of personalized product recommendations cannot be overstated. They serve as pivotal tools in augmenting user experience and driving sales for e-commerce platforms. Traditional recommendation systems often rely on either textual product descriptions or image features in isolation. However, amalgamating both text and image data can furnish a more comprehensive understanding of products and user preferences, consequently facilitating more accurate and effective recommendations. This repository delves into the development of a multimodal recommendation system for fashion products, employing deep learning techniques.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to enhance the product recommendation system of a fashion e-commerce platform to elevate user engagement and bolster sales. The aim is to devise a system capable of recommending fashion items to users based on their preferences and browsing history, harnessing both textual product descriptions and visual features extracted from product images.

## Approach

### 1. Data Collection
- Assemble a dataset of fashion products encompassing both textual descriptions and corresponding images. The dataset should encompass information such as product titles, descriptions, categories, prices, and images of the products.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Textual Data: Employ tokenization, stopwords removal, and conversion of text to numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- Image Data: Perform resizing, normalization, and augmentation (if necessary) to ensure consistency in image sizes and formats.

### 3. Feature Extraction
- Textual Features: Extract features from product titles and descriptions leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Pre-trained language models like BERT or word embeddings can be utilized to capture semantic information from the text.
- Visual Features: Utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract visual features from product images. Pre-trained CNN models such as VGG, ResNet, or Inception can be fine-tuned on the fashion product dataset to capture relevant visual patterns.

### 4. Multimodal Fusion
- Combine the textual and visual features using fusion techniques such as concatenation, element-wise multiplication, or attention mechanisms to create a unified multimodal representation of each product.

### 5. Recommendation Model
- Devise a deep neural network architecture (e.g., multi-layer perceptron or recurrent neural network) that takes the multimodal features of products as input and learns to predict the likelihood of user preference or purchase intent for each product.

### 6. Model Training
- Train the multimodal recommendation model on the dataset utilizing appropriate loss functions (e.g., binary cross-entropy loss for binary preference prediction) and optimization techniques (e.g., Adam optimizer).

### 7. Evaluation
- Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ranking metrics like mean average precision (MAP) or normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) on a held-out validation set.

### 8. Deployment
- Deploy the trained model as a recommendation service integrated into the fashion e-commerce platform, furnishing personalized product recommendations to users based on their browsing history and preferences.

## Results

Post-training and evaluation, the multimodal fashion product recommendation system exhibited promising results, showcasing high accuracy and effectiveness in recommending pertinent products to users. It showcased the capacity to leverage both textual and visual information to encapsulate diverse aspects of fashion items and offer personalized recommendations tailored to individual user preferences.

## Conclusion

This case study underscores the efficacy of deep learning techniques in crafting multimodal recommendation systems that harness both text and image data. By amalgamating information from textual product descriptions and visual features extracted from images, the model can proffer more precise and personalized recommendations, thereby fostering enhanced user satisfaction and engagement on the fashion e-commerce platform.
